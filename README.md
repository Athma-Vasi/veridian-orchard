- **Theme Customization**: Extensively modified core Hydrogen files to create a unique design while ensuring compatibility with Shopify's Admin Editor, allowing the client to manage content without code changes.
- **Performance Optimization**: Focused on optimizing front-end performance through code refactoring, efficient data fetching strategies, and adherence to modern web standards (e.g., using native CSS), ensuring a fast and seamless user experience.
- **Modular Design for Maintainability**: Adopted a modular approach in theme development, allowing for easy updates and maintenance by the client without requiring code changes, thus ensuring long-term sustainability of the platform.
- **Cart Management**: Implemented advanced cart functionalities using React Hooks and context to provide a dynamic and responsive custom shopping experience, enhancing user engagement and conversion rates.
- **TypeScript Adoption**: Leveraged TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience, reducing runtime errors and enhancing code maintainability.
- **SEO and AI Best Practices**: Ensured the platform adheres to SEO best practices and optimized for AI-driven search engines by utilizing React Server Components for server-side rendering, resulting in improved search engine rankings and visibility.
