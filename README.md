| Data Architecture | Architected and implemented comprehensive data models utilizing Shopify's Metafields for custom product attributes (e.g., care-level, light-needs, air-purifying-rating) and Metaobjects for structured, reusable content (e.g., brand story, team bios). |

| Front-End Performance | Achieved excellent loading speed and a seamless user experience by refactoring and customizing the base theme's JavaScript and CSS, adhering to modern web standards (e.g., using OKLCH for perceptually uniform color variables). |

| User Experience (UX) | Built dynamic, interactive collection pages featuring advanced filtering and sorting logic, enhancing product discovery for users with specific needs (e.g., "Easy Care" or "Air Purifying" collections). |

| Theme Customization | Extensive modification of core Liquid files, including custom templates, snippets, and sections, ensuring a unique brand identity while retaining full compatibility with the Shopify Admin Editor. |

| Maintenance & Scalability | Developed using a modular approach to Liquid sections and CSS, facilitating easy content updates by the client via the Shopify Admin without touching code. |
